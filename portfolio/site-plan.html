About Me
</h1>
<h3>
My name is Matthew Foushee. I am 22 years old. I am engaged and will be married shortly. I have been programming now for 10 years finding my love of programming in 6th grade in a lego robotics unit of some class. The following year I joined my schools lego robotics team where I programmed the robot using the block programming that gets provided. I did that for only one year where starting in 9th grade I joined my school’s FTC team making actual robots out of metal and motors programming the robot in Java. I fell in love with it and taught myself(with help from youtube) how to program. My life for the next 3 years was: school, Robotics, home, program personal project, repeat

FTC robotics
</h1>
<h3>
FTC robotics is the First Tech Challenge. It's an official world wide league that releases a yearly competition with unique rules and gameplay that each team needs to design a robot to compete in.

<h1>
Personal Project Journey
</h1>
<h3>
I started many many many projects and not finishing most of them have only a few saved to Github or the files saved. I started in Java because that was the language I was learning for robotics and started immediately making graphical type things. I learned all sorts of things involving the graphics pipeline and by senior year I switched to c++, the freedom I felt it gave me was immense.
</h3>
<h1>
Why I switched to C++
</h1>
<h3>
For the first 3 years of my programming life I used Java. It was familiar and read like English, once you knew how to program. After I made my own custom graphics renderer without any help of the GPU(dumb idea) I blamed the language for being slow because I didn't know otherwise. This caused me to look into what “real” graphics engines were made with and the resounding answer is c++. In my learning journey though I did learn that you NEED to use the graphics card to render things fast/optimally so I started doing that too but now in a new language.

<h1>
Why will people come to your site?
</h1>
<h3>
People will come to my site to see what projects I have made, What projects I will make, and who I am and what I believe when it comes to code design.
</h3>
<h1>
What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
</h1>
<h3>
Who is Matthew
Can he program
What has he programmed
</h3>
<h1>
What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
</h1>
<h3>
They will see images/demonstrations of my projects and my takes on programming them.
</h3>
<h1>
What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
</h1>
<h3>
I guess the knowhow to program but that is sort of a given
</h3>
<h1>
Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
</h1>

      <p>
          I will need to compile a list and descriptions for all of my projects. This will take much time and so will be completed shortly.
          TODO: Compile list of projects, both history and goal

      <p>Images for the Page 2, This will make more sense to have images of the running projects. I will need more time to get them back into a working state. I will also have WAY more that 2 images here</p>

      <h3>Future Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I only really have 3 future projects in mind. The first one is a web ran maze creator with the ability to solve it with an AI(I could try out different AI's) they would be visually representing how they solve the maze
        The next idea is
